# CSX combined optimization
This repository uses the [simsopt framework](https://github.com/hiddenSymmetries/simsopt) and the combined approach technique described by [R. Jorge et.al.](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6587/acd957) 
to optimize tentative designs of the Columbia Stellarator eXperiment (CSX), which will eventually replace the existing [Columbia Nonneutral Torus (CNT)](http://sites.apam.columbia.edu/CNT/index.htm)
