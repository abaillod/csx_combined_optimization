# CSX combined optimization
This repository uses the [simsopt framework](https://github.com/hiddenSymmetries/simsopt) and the combined approach technique described by [R. Jorge et.al.](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6587/acd957) 
to optimize tentative designs of the Columbia Stellarator eXperiment (CSX), which will eventually replace the existing [Columbia Nonneutral Torus (CNT)](http://sites.apam.columbia.edu/CNT/index.htm)

## Installation
First, install simsopt and VMEC2000. You might also need to create a `runs` directory manually, by running
```
mkdir runs
```

## Running the code
The main script is `combined_csx_optimization_with_windowpane_coils.py`. It can be run locally by creating an input file in the `./inputs` directory - just copy-paste the `inputs/standard_input.py` file into a new
file, and set each input to the value you desire. Then, run the code locally (not recommended) with:
```
python combined_csx_optimization_with_windowpane_coils.py name_of_your_input
```
To run the code on the Ginsburg cluster, simply use the sbatch script `run_combined_approach.sb` and do
```
sbatch run_combined_approach.sb name_of_your_input
```

## Analysing the output
Outputs can be analyzed interactively using the `plot_combined_approach_results.ipynb` jupyter notebook, or all relevant figures can be generated by running 
```
plot_combined_approach_results.py YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS
```
where `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS` is the date and time at which the optimization was started (name of the directory in `./runs`). Figures are then stored in
`runs/YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS/figures`.
